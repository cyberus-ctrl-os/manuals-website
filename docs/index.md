# CTRL-OS Manuals

[CTRL-OS](https://ctrl-os.com/) is a downstream distribution of select NixOS/nixpkgs releases
with extended support. The NixOS project doesn't publish manuals for
releases that don't receive community support any longer. That is why
we publish the manuals for versions that receive extended support via CTRL-OS here!

For general information about CTRL-OS, please visit
[ctrl-os.com](https://ctrl-os.com/). CTRL-OS-specific technical
documentation is located at
[docs.ctrl-os.com](https://docs.ctrl-os.com/).
